# Python
My python code, an examplar project to calculate specific
car-related outputs will be presented and will be joined to 
a program named engine calculator.

Engine Calculator initial release [1.0]
  Program can do various functions:
    - Calculate horsepower from given torque in either newtonmeters or lb-ft
    - Make several conversions like any program (mile/km)
    - Calculate size (displacement) of the engine in ccm
Engine calculator [1.1]
  Program added functions:
    - Draw a graph from given torque figures, calculating horsepower along the way.
